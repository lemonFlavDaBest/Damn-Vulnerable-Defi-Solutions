# Challenge #5 - Selfie

## The Challenge
The goal of this challenge is to drain the funds of the dao utilizing their
own governance mechanisms. Additionally in this challenge there exists 
an flashloan pool that gives you access to the governance tokens

## The contract issue
We can borrow (via flashloan) enough tokens to pass whatever action we want
through the goverance contract.

## The Exploit
1. We deploy a contract named SelfiePoolExploiter that inherits the IERC3156FlashBorrower
contract because we want borrow from a flashloan contract that allows borrowing of the 
governance token. 

2. We create a function called **initFlashloan()** that initializes a flashloan from the Selfie
borrowing pool. It calls the SelfiePool flashLoan function and borrows all of the pools token.

```
function initFlashLoan() external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, 'owner initiates flashloans');
        bool succ = selfie.flashLoan(this, address(DVtoken), DVtoken.balanceOf(address(selfie)), '0x');
        require(succ, "Flashloan function failed");
    }
```
