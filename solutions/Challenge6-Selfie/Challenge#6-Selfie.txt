# The Challenge
The goal of this challenge is to drain the funds of the dao utilizing their
own governance mechanisms. Additionally in this challenge there exists 
an flashloan pool that gives you access to the governance tokens

# The Exploit
Idea: I think the first vector of attack is just to flashloan the funds
to make a proposal, then flashloan the funds again to execute the proposal.
