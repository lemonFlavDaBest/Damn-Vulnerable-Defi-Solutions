# Challenge #7 - Compromised

## The Challenge
An exchange is using 'trusted' oracles to price the sale of Non-Fungible tokens. The goal is
take all of the ether from the exchange contract.

## Brainstorming ideas 
I think i need to push a couple of my own oracles. and use those to influence price. sell the nft
and voila.
