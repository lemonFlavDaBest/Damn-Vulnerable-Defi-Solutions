# Challenge #7 - Compromised

## The Challenge
An exchange is using 'trusted' oracles to price the sale of Non-Fungible tokens. The goal is
take all of the ether from the exchange contract.

## Brainstorming ideas 
I think i need to push a couple of my own oracles. and use those to influence price. sell the nft
and voila.

New idea:
what i think, deploy 4 oracles setting the price at 0. that makes the median price zero. mint a few,
deploy more oracles with higher price, then sell them off. 

New idea:
the contract for  trustful oracle renounces the role of trusted whatever, if it renounces to a zero address
maybe i can set the price via the zero adress through the constructor of another contract
